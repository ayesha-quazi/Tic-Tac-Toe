# Tic-Tac-Toe

A simple and interactive **Tic-Tac-Toe game** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This project offers a clean and responsive 3x3 grid interface, allowing two players to enjoy the timeless classic.

## Features

- **HTML**:  
  Structures the game board and user interface, including:  
  - A 3x3 grid layout for gameplay.  
  - Status display to show the current player's turn or the game result.  

- **CSS**:  
  - Adds visually appealing and modern styles for the grid, buttons, and player marks.  
  - Ensures a responsive design that works seamlessly on various devices.  

- **JavaScript**:  
  - Implements core game logic, including:  
    - Turn-based gameplay with X and O alternation.  
    - Real-time detection of winning combinations or a draw.  
    - A reset button to start a new round.  

## Further Enhancements (Future Plans)  

- I'll try adding a single-player mode with AI to play against the computer.  
- Which includes animations for smoother transitions and visual feedback.  
- Which also allows customization of themes or player markers.  
- And will try keeping a scoreboard to track wins and losses.
